# Robothing-Code-Station

Hello. 
This is the github repository that will be storing the foundational code for the RescueBot Robot Operating System. 
If you are reading this, you have been assigned to work in what is arguably the most important yet mentally demanding field of the RescueBot team. Truly, access is granted to only the most valiant minds society can offer, hardened through the years behing the walls of SFU prison. 

But heed this: software is no easy subject. You will stumble, and you will fall. And this is expected. I have no following words of comfort. 

I wish you all the best.
